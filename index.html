      <p><strong>Elder Scrolls V:</strong> Skyrim is an action role-playing game, playable from either a first or third-person perspective. The player may freely roam over the land of Skyrim which is an open world environment consisting of wilderness expanses, dungeons, cities, towns, fortresses, and villages. Players may navigate the game world more quickly by riding horses or by utilizing a fast-travel system which allows them to warp to previously discovered locations.
      The game's main quest can be completed or ignored at the player's preference after the first stage of the quest is finished. However, some quests rely on the main storyline being at least partially completed. Non-player characters (NPCs) populate the world and can be interacted with in a number of ways: the player may engage them in conversation, marry an eligible NPC, kill them or engage in a nonlethal "brawl".

      <p><strong>Devil May Cry 5: </strong>In Red Grave City on May 16, devil hunter Nero finds a demon named Urizen who has planted a demonic tree called Qliphoth in the city; it is killing people for their blood. Dante is ultimately defeated and ejected from the Qliphoth with his sword Rebellion shattered. His allies Lady and Trish are captured, and an ally of Dante, V, convinces the weakened Nero to escape. On June 15, Nero returns to Red Grave after being outfitted with the "Devil Breaker" prosthetic arm his friend Nico made for him after Urizen amputated his right arm.
      Nero meets up with V, who is seeking Qliphoth for its fruit—born of condensed human blood—which makes whomever consumes it the king of the Underworld. As the pair destroy the Qliphoth's roots while searching for Dante, 
      Nero rescues Lady. V seeks the Devil Sword Sparda in fear of its namesake's descendants acquiring it. V splits off to find the Sparda first and discovers it along with a hibernating Dante, whose presence was being hidden by the sword.

      <p><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong> is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment where players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. In terms of structure, Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, 
      which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas, scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely. Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution. The game also integrates a "chemistry engine" that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.
       For example, players may take advantage of the game's dynamic weather by throwing metal objects at enemies during thunderstorms to attract a lightning strike. However, the level of realism offered in the "chemistry engine" also means that players will equally attract an unavoidable fatal lightning strike if wearing any metal during thunderstorms. These design approaches result in a generally unstructured and interactive world that rewards experimentation and allows for nonlinear completion of the story.

      <p><strong>Dark Souls </strong>employs minimalist storytelling to convey its plot and lore. Historical events in its world and their significance are often implicit or left to player interpretation rather than being fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from non-player characters within the game, flavor text from items, and world design.

The opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game. Dragons once ruled the world. In this period, a man known as Gwyn happens upon an object known as the "First Flame" and finds the "Lord Souls." He and his allies use their power to defeat the dragons, which starts the Age of Fire. Over time, the flames begin to fade with the rise of humans, and Gwyn sacrifices himself to prolong the Age of Fire. With the flame artificially rekindled, the undead curse begins to plague humanity, causing some humans to resurrect upon death constantly.

      <p><strong>Dark Souls III: </strong>Set in the Kingdom of Lothric, a bell has rung to signal that the First Flame, responsible for maintaining the Age of Fire, is dying out. As has happened many times before, the coming of the Age of Dark produces the undead: cursed beings that rise up after death. The Age of Fire can be prolonged with the linking of the fire, a ritual in which great lords and heroes sacrifice their souls to rekindle the First Flame. However, Prince Lothric, the chosen linker for this age, has abandoned his duty and instead chooses to watch the flame die from afar. The bell is the last hope for the Age of Fire, resurrecting previous Lords of Cinder (heroes who linked the flame in past ages) to attempt to link the fire again; however, all but one Lord shirk their duty.
The Ashen One, an Undead who failed to become a Lord of Cinder and thus called an Unkindled, rises and must link the fire by returning Prince Lothric and the defiant Lords of Cinder to their thrones in Firelink Shrine. The Lords include the Abyss Watchers, a legion of warriors sworn to protect the land from the Abyss and linked by a single soul; Yhorm the Giant, who was once a conqueror of the very people for whom he then sacrificed his life; and Saint Aldrich of the Deep, who became a Lord of Cinder despite his ravenous appetite for both men and gods. Lothric himself was raised in order to link the First Flame, but rejected his destiny and chose to watch the fire fade.

        <p>2022, <strong>Sword Art Online</strong>, a new brand of VRMMO, has been released. Kirito is one the 10,000 that logged in to SAO during the first day. Unfortunately, they found themselves soon unable to log out and trapped inside this deadly game.

        Like the name says, this anime completely focuses on sword fighting. Contrary to most MMO, SAO doesn’t have a magic system. All the player can rely on are the sword skills. Sword skills are system assisted, but you have to do the motions yourself. Kirito itself is a dual wielding swordsman, and has the fastest reaction time in the game.--There are <strong>4</strong> Seasons to this Anime.

While mostly a gag anime, the fights in this anime rivals Bleach in terms of action. Gintoki is an excellent samurai and was known as the “White Devil” back during the war. If you want to watch a gag anime with good fights here and there this is the best choice. But be warned, some of the arcs are pretty sad and heavy.
